    Read the file {list_file_path}, which contains paths to code files (one per line).
    For each listed path:
      - Read the content of the corresponding file.
      - Add a comment header with the file name, in the format "# File: path/file.py".
    Combine everything in sequence and save it to {final_result}.

    The file {final_result}, containing the concatenation of all listed files,
    with clear separation using valid comments (e.g., "# File: ...").
    No content should be invented or modified â€” only faithful reading and writing of actual files.
